# Task 1 - Use what you have learned to process the Landsat files provided, this time, you know you are
# interested in the NVDI index which will use Bands 4 (red, aka vis) and 5 (near-infrared, aka nir) from the
# Landsat 8 imagery. Data provided are monthly (a couple are missing due to cloud coverage) during the
# year 2015 for the State of RI.

# First check to see if file exists
# Use the function of search and file first search for folder then file in order.
